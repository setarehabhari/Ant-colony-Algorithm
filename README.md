Solving a task optimization problem using ant colony
Assignment problem is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem. In its most general form, the problem is as follows:
The problem instance has n agents and n tasks. Any agent can be assigned to perform any task, incurring some cost that may vary depending on the agent-task assignment. It is required to perform as many tasks as possible by assigning at most one agent to each task and at most one task to each agent, in such a way that the total cost of the assignment is minimized.
We will solve this problem using ant colony which is an algorithm that is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. Artificial ants stand for multi-agent methods inspired by the behavior of real ants. The pheromone-based communication of biological ants is often the predominant paradigm used.
